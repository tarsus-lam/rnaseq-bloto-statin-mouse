# Role of ZNF335 in Cellular Cholesterol Metabolism and Statin Response

## Project Overview

This project investigates the role of **ZNF335** in regulating cellular cholesterol metabolism and statin response. Liver samples from CRISPRi/CRISPRa-modified mice were analyzed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify differentially expressed genes and key pathways involved in lipid metabolism, focusing on the effects of Zfp335 and its potential impact on high cholesterol and statin efficacy.

## Objectives

1. Analyze the role of Zfp335 in cholesterol metabolism using CRISPRi/CRISPRa-modified mice.
2. Identify differentially expressed genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism.
3. Conduct functional enrichment analysis to explore regulatory networks related to Zfp335.
4. Assess Zfp335â€™s potential impact on statin response.

## Installation Methods

You can install the required dependencies in two ways: using a bash script or a Docker container.

### Method 1: Install Dependencies via Bash Script

Download and run the install_tools.sh script:

```bash
bash install_tools.sh
```

### Method 2: Install Dependencies via Docker

Alternatively, build and run a Docker container with all dependencies:

1. Build the Docker Image:
```bash
docker build -t rnaseq_tools .
```
2. Run the Docker Container:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/your/data:/data rnaseq_tools
```

## Workflow and Key Scripts

### 1. Quality Control (QC)
The function of this step is to assess the quality of raw sequencing reads to identify any potential issues with the data before further analysis.

- **Input**: Raw FASTQ files are used as input to check for quality.

- **Output**: FastQC quality reports are generated, detailing per-base quality scores and other key metrics.

- **Script**: scriptFastQC

### 2. Trimming and Filtering
This step removes low-quality bases and adapter sequences from the raw reads, ensuring high-quality data for downstream analysis.

- **Input**: Raw FASTQ files are provided as input to be trimmed and filtered for quality.
  
- **Output**: The output consists of trimmed FASTQ files, with adapters and low-quality sequences removed.
  
- **Script**: scriptTrimmomatic

### 3. Genome Indexing
This step generates a genome index to prepare the reference genome for efficient read alignment in later steps.

- **Input**: The input includes the mouse genome FASTA file and GTF annotation file.

- **Output**: STAR genome index files are created, which are used for aligning RNA-seq reads.

- **Script**: scriptSTARIndex

### 4. First Pass Alignment
This step aligns the RNA-seq reads to the mouse genome to generate preliminary BAM files and identify splice junctions.

- **Input**: Trimmed FASTQ files are used as input to perform the first pass of read alignment.

- **Output**: The output is BAM files containing aligned reads, along with identified splice junctions.

- **Script**: scriptSTARPass1

### 5. Second Pass Alignment
This step refines the alignment process by using the splice junctions identified in the first pass to improve the accuracy of the alignments.

- **Input**: The input includes BAM files from the first pass, along with splice junction data.

- **Output**: Final aligned BAM files are produced, with improved read alignment around splice sites.

- **Script**: scriptSTARPass2

### 6. Mappability Statistics
This step evaluates the mapping quality of the RNA-seq data by calculating percentages of mapped, unmapped, and multi-mapped reads.

- **Input**: STAR log files from the alignment process are provided as input to analyze mappability statistics.

- **Output**: Mappability statistics are generated, along with a pie chart showing the proportion of mapped, unmapped, and multi-mapped reads.

- **Script**: alignment_analysis.py

### 7. BAM File Processing (Indexing, Marking Duplicates, Merging)
This step involves processing BAM files by indexing them, marking duplicate reads, and merging multiple BAM files into combined datasets.

- **Input**: The input includes the BAM files generated from the second pass alignment.

- **Output**: Indexed, duplicate-marked, and merged BAM files are produced, along with duplicate metrics plots for quality assessment.

- **Script**s: scriptIndexBam, scriptMarkDuplicates, scriptMergeBam, duplicate_metrics_plot.py

### 8. Read Coverage
This step calculates and visualizes the read coverage across the genome to assess the evenness and depth of sequencing coverage.

- **Input**: BAM files from the alignment process are used as input to calculate read coverage.

- **Output**: A read coverage plot is generated, and raw counts of coverage across the genome are output for further analysis.

- **Script**s: scriptPlotCoverage, calculate_coverage.py

### 9. Feature Counting
This step quantifies the number of reads mapped to each gene, providing a gene-level count matrix for differential expression analysis.

- **Input**: BAM files are provided as input to count the number of reads mapped to genes.

- **Output**: A gene count matrix is produced, detailing the number of reads aligned to each gene.

- **Script**: scriptFeatureCounts

### 10. Differential Expression Analysis
This step identifies genes that are differentially expressed between experimental conditions, such as wild-type vs. CRISPR-modified samples.

- **Input**: The input includes the gene count matrix and sample information.

- **Output**: Differentially expressed genes are identified, and visualizations such as heatmaps and PCA plots are generated to explore the data.

- **Script**s: scriptDESeq2, scriptDESeq2.R

### 11. Functional Enrichment
This step performs functional enrichment analysis to identify biological pathways and functions that are significantly associated with the differentially expressed genes.

- **Input**: A list of differentially expressed genes is used as input for functional enrichment.

- **Output**: The output includes a list of enriched biological functions or pathways based on the gene list.

- **Script**s: scriptEnrichR, scriptEnrichR.R

## Running the Workflow

### Option 1: Running the Entire Workflow with Nextflow
Once you have Nextflow installed and configured to use Docker, you can execute the entire workflow with:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -with-docker
```

This command will run all steps of the pipeline automatically, leveraging the Docker container for a consistent environment across all processes.

### Option 2: Running Individual Scripts on an SGE Cluster
You can also manually submit individual scripts to an SGE-managed cluster. For example, to submit the **FastQC** step, use the following:

```bash
qsub scriptFastQC.sh
```

Repeat this for each step in the pipeline as required by your cluster environment.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this README, you will be able to replicate the RNA-seq analysis workflow to study the role of ZNF335 in cholesterol metabolism and statin response. The workflow includes quality control, alignment, differential expression analysis, and functional enrichment.
